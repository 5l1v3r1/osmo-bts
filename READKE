Repsoitory for new BTS-side A-bis code

This is the code that was originally developed inside osmocom-bb.git
for turning modified OsmocomBB-supported phones into a simplistic BTS.

However, the BTS-side A-bis is also going to be needed for other projects, thus
the split.

It doesn't really build yet, as a lot of dependencies have not yet been
resolved.
